It is if everyone dies alone
Does that scare you?
I don't wanna be alone
I look for you
Every day, every night
I close my eyes
From the fear, from the light
As I wander down the avenue, so confused
Guess I'll try and force a smile
Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday
Couples holding hands on a runway
They're all posing in a picture frame
Whilst my world's crashing down
Solo shadow on a sidewalk
Just want somebody to die for
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day
While my world's crashing down
I just want somebody to die for
I long for you
Just a touch (does that scare you?)
Of your hand
You don't leave my mind
Lonely days, I'm feeling
Like a fool for dreaming
As I wander down the avenue, so confused
Guess I'll try and force a smile
Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday
Couples holding hands on a runway
They're all posing in a picture frame
Whilst my world's crashing down
Solo shadow on a sidewalk
Just want somebody to die for
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day
While my world's crashing down
I just want somebody to die for
I just want somebody to die for (to die for)
I just want somebody to die for
(Does that scare you?)
(I don't wanna be alone)
Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday
Couples holding hands on a runway (oh)
They're all posing in a picture frame
Whilst my world's crashing down
Solo shadow on a sidewalk
Just want somebody to die for
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day
While my world's crashing down
I just want somebody to die for
I just want somebody to die for (to die for)
My head is filled with ruins
Most of them, I built with you
Now the dust no longer moves
Don't disturb the ghost of you, mmh
They are empty, they are worn
Tell me what we built this for
On my way to somethin' more
You're that one I can't ignore, mmh
I'm gonna miss you
I'm still there
Sometimes I wish we never built this palace
But real love is never a waste of time, mmh
Yeah, I know just what you're sayin'
And I regret ever complainin'
'Bout this heart and all it's breakin'
It was beauty we were makin', mmh
And I know we'll both move on
You'll forgive what I did wrong
They will love the better you
But I still own the ghost of you, mmh
I'm gonna miss you
I'm still there
Sometimes I wish we never built this palace
But real love is never a waste of time, oh
I'm gonna miss you
I'm still there
Sometimes I wish we never built this palace
But real love is never a waste of time
But real love is never a waste of time
