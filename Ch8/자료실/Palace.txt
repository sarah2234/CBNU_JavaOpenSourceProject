My head is filled with ruins
Most of them, I built with you
Now the dust no longer moves
Don't disturb the ghost of you, mmh
They are empty, they are worn
Tell me what we built this for
On my way to somethin' more
You're that one I can't ignore, mmh
I'm gonna miss you
I'm still there
Sometimes I wish we never built this palace
But real love is never a waste of time, mmh
Yeah, I know just what you're sayin'
And I regret ever complainin'
'Bout this heart and all it's breakin'
It was beauty we were makin', mmh
And I know we'll both move on
You'll forgive what I did wrong
They will love the better you
But I still own the ghost of you, mmh
I'm gonna miss you
I'm still there
Sometimes I wish we never built this palace
But real love is never a waste of time, oh
I'm gonna miss you
I'm still there
Sometimes I wish we never built this palace
But real love is never a waste of time
But real love is never a waste of time
